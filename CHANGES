[sorry.. no News before feb 1998]

19 February 1998
+ Hopefully fixed a bug that kept from running under glibc2.
+ Hopefully [thanks to Mr. Branko Bratkovic] 
  <bkbratko@ardu.raaf.defence.gov.au>] got printer support working again.
+ Set up fprint-3.0.1

14 July 1998
+ Meant to upload 3.0.1 way back when.  Never did.  This package gets much
  less e-mail traffic than some of my other endeavours.
+ Added the manpage and psf_fonts.txt file provided by Mr. Bratkovic
+ Stick 3.0.1 at my page pending confirmation that I didn't forget anything.
+ Eventually I do want to re-write a lot of the code.  I just haven't had
  time and the time I spend on my programs often is proportional to how 
  many e-mails I get about them.
  
20 July 1998
+ Finally added the psf stuff in that I kept forgetting to.  Re-did some 
  documentation.  Bundled up 3.0.2.  Hopefully this will be good enough
  to put out to freshmean.net and sunsite.

18 August 1998
+ Fixed so ascii codes > 128 are printed properly as gifs.  Thanks to
  Pino Zollo <pinoz@highway.com.py> for the bug report.
  
11 September 1998
+ Made a 3.0.3 release.  Nothing fixed since August.
