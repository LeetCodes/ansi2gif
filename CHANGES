15 June 1999
+ Decided to branch into a new package, instead of just making this a newer
  version of fontprint.  Fontprint is good at what it does, no need to add
  all this excess specialization.  Also lets me code from scratch.
+ Got it creating a gif of linux_logo output.

3 July 1999
+ Cleaning up and renaming files.

5 July 1999
+ Got animation working!
+ Merged in some whirgif code.  Basically just added it to be called.  Much
  simpler than telling people they have to install a zillion packaged before
  they can use my program.
+ Got blink working!
+ ansi2gif opens a temp file as /tmp/ansi2gif_%i.gif where %i is the pid.
  I am worried about the security of that.  Do I need to check for symlinks
  before opening it?
+ Started cleaning up the code the best I could

6 July 1999
+ Got command line options working
+ Tweaked the colors a bit.
+ Fixed up the makefile
+ Made it so arbitray x and y sized can be used [instead of fixed 80x25]
+ Fixed an error where it was reading beyond the end of the file
+ Tweaked default_font a bit more.  Fix up the documentation and I will
  be ready to announce!

8 July 1999
+ Got reports the ansi2gif works under Solaris, needing only "getopt()" code.
  I probably should add that to the distribution.  [thanks to
  arthurj@uccs.jpl.nasa.gov]
+ Added check to be sure output file is specified.  Otherwise it will
  segfault.  Thanks to Ben Canning <bdc@bethany.edu>
