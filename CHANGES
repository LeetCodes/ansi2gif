15 June 1999
+ Decided to branch into a new package, instead of just making this a newer
  version of fontprint.  Fontprint is good at what it does, no need to add
  all this excess specialization.  Also lets me code from scratch.
+ Got it creating a gif of linux_logo output.

3 July 1999
+ Cleaning up and renaming files.

5 July 1999
+ Got animation working!
+ Merged in some whirgif code.  Basically just added it to be called.  Much
  simpler than telling people they have to install a zillion packaged before
  they can use my program.
+ Got blink working!
+ ansi2gif opens a temp file as /tmp/ansi2gif_%i.gif where %i is the pid.
  I am worried about the security of that.  Do I need to check for symlinks
  before opening it?
+ Started cleaning up the code the best I could

6 July 1999
+ Got command line options working
+ Tweaked the colors a bit.
+ Fixed up the makefile
+ Made it so arbitray x and y sized can be used [instead of fixed 80x25]
+ Fixed an error where it was reading beyond the end of the file
+ Tweaked default_font a bit more.  Fix up the documentation and I will
  be ready to announce!

RELEASE 0.9.9

8 July 1999
+ Got reports the ansi2gif works under Solaris, needing only "getopt()" code.
  I probably should add that to the distribution.  [thanks to
  arthurj _at_ uccs.jpl.nasa.gov]
+ Added check to be sure output file is specified.  Otherwise it will
  segfault.  Thanks to Ben Canning <bdc _at_ bethany.edu>
  
26 November 2000
+ Added a fix so it handles tabs correctly.  Hardcoded as 4 spaces for now
  Should make it configurable.  It is hard going back on code this old to 
  work with it.
  
RELEASE 0.9.10
  
4 March 2003
+ Split off png package

RELEASE 0.9.11

18 October 2004
+ Fix some buffer overrun bugs from ansi2gif
+ Tried to get animated gifs to go faster.  Not possible very easily :(
+ Fixed a few buffer overuns that either crashed or skipped the first char.

RELEASE 0.9.12

15 August 2007
+ Re-merge the two packages, as libgf supports GIFs again
  due to patents expiring.

17 August 2007
+ Finish EPS support.
+ Allow input/output from stdin/stdout
+ Detect if we are called as ansi2gif/ansi2eps/ansi2png and
  act accordingly.

RELEASE 0.9.13

20 January 2012
+ Make errors/warnings print to stderr so they don't contaminate
  gifs being printed to stdout
+ Fix warnings from modern gcc
+ Implement --ysize auto at the request of mrmocha

RELEASE 0.9.14

5 January 2014
+ Auto-detect format based on extension

6 January 2014
+ Re-write a lot of the color handling code.
  This was due to a request from Chad Doebelin for 256-color support.
+ Support 24-bit color ANS (although approximated on png/gif)

RELEASE 0.10.0
