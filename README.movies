A bit of a hack, but to make a movie of an animated ansi:

ansi2gif --movie ./utopia21.ans utopia21.mp4

It will make a huge directory of png files and then suggest
a command line to create the final movie, assuming you have
ffmpeg installed, something like:
	ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i 'ansi2gif-123/*png' output.mp4
