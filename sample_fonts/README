These are some standard VGA fonts that can be used with the "ansi2gif"
utility.

c.fnt        -- the font I use for my console.  Comes with Slackware.
default.fnt  -- the one currently being used by ansi2gif
future.fnt   -- a neat looking font I picked up ages ago.
marie.fnt    -- a Tolkien font I made a long time ago for my gf
medieval.fnt -- another cool looking font I found long ago

To replace the default font file used by ansi2gif, first make the
font2include program.  Typing "make" in this directory should handle that.

Then "font2include font.fnt > default_font.h"

where font.fnt is the new font you want to be the default.

Just copy the resulting "default_font.h" file into the main ansi2gif source
code directory and recompile.
